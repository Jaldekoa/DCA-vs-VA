# DCA vs VA
In the following experiment, two investment strategies will be compared: Dollar Cost Average (DCA) and Value Averaging (VA). Both strategies will be applied on the S&P500 index.

## Strategy
In the DCA strategy, $100 will be invested monthly, regardless of the price of the S&P500. These investments will be maintained until the end.

In the VA strategy, the target value of the portfolio is established for each period and will be invested or divested depending on whether the value of the portfolio at that date is higher or lower than the previously established value. The target will be set as an increase of $100 per month plus a percentage of the previous period's target total. The percentage in this experiment is 7%.
